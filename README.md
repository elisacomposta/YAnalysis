# YAnalysis

This repository contains the output data from simulation experiments conducted with [YClient](https://github.com/elisacomposta/YClient) and [YServer](https://github.com/elisacomposta/YServer).
It also includes the code used to generate plots, as well as the figures themselves.

#### Notes
