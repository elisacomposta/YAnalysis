# YAnalysis

This repository contains the output data from simulation experiments conducted with [YClient](https://github.com/elisacomposta/YClient) and [YServer](https://github.com/elisacomposta/YServer).
It also includes the code used to generate plots, as well as the figures themselves.

#### Notes
- The folder `simulations` contains the output of the experiments, in _db_ format
- The toxicity comparison plot uses real-world data from the dataset presented by Pierri et al. (2023): 
_ITA-ELECTION-2022: A multi-platform dataset of social media conversations around the 2022 Italian general election_, available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05119
- The file `y_result_visualization.ipynb` is a notebook which generates and shows all the figures.
